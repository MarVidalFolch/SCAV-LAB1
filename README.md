# SCAV-LAB1

## Mar Vidal-Folch Angerri - NIA: 204751

In this lab we have worked with JPEG in different exercises:

### Exercise 1
---
We have created a script with two functions: to go from RGB to YUV and viceversa. The user can insert the desired input in both of them. 
### Exercise 2
---
We have used ffmpeg to rescale an image to a lower quality. We have done different examples to see how does ffmpeg work. There is a folder for each example containing the output image and a screenshot of the operations done.

Different examples:
- 1: Simple rescaling to an specific size (320x240)
- 2: Keepting the aspect ratio 
- 3: Using variables: double the image width
- 4: Using variables: half the size of the picture

### Exercise 3
---
We used ffmpeg to transform an image into b/w. Then, we have compressed it. 
Doing the compression we went from a 857,2kB b/w image to a 64,1kB b/w image so, the compression is considerable. 

### Exercise 4
---
We have created a script with a function that applies the run-length encoding from a sequence input by the user. 

### Exercise 5
---
We have created a script that computes the DCT from a png black and white image.
